# Google Searchbar Jump Fix
This fixes the following bugs:
- When pressing '/' while in the images section, it doesn't jump to the searchbar, unless you have clicked on an image
- Pressing escape after you have the searchbar focused, keeps the cursor pointer on the searchbar

## Build
- Run `npm install`, if you haven't already
- Run `npm run build`

## Configure
- Open the browser
- Click on the hamburger menu on the top right
- Click extensions
- Click load unpacked
- Click the folder which has this repository (the folder which has the manifest.json file)
